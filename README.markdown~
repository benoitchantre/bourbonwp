BourbonWP
===============================

This is a naked Wordpress theme that you can use to create your own theme.
The markup is based on Bruce Lawson's [Designing a Blog with HTML5](http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/)
I'm sure you can get something fancier, based on the latest Twenty-something Wordpress theme, but I like this one as it's plain an simple.
The naming convention is taken straight from Bootstrap2 because I like it.
The css is generated using Sass (hence, you need Ruby on your machine) and the awesome [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io) libraries.

The latest update to the styles folder has been done on the 23rd of September 2013.

Instead of using only DIVs for content layout, it uses HTML5 tags, including [header](http://html5doctor.com/the-header-element/), 
[footer](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_footer.asp), 
[nav](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_nav.asp), 
[article](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_article.asp), 
and [section](http://html5doctor.com/the-section-element/).

In functions.php I have registered a custom menu, activated post thumbnails, registered the sidebar.

As a bonus, cheatsheet.txt contains some useful snippets to make your development faster :D

Getting Started
---------------
1. Install Ruby on your systen if you haven't already. Once it's installed, install SASS (gem install sass).
2. Add the BourbonWP folder to your wp-content/themes folder.
3. Create a first version of your stylesheets by opening the command line, switching to the "styles" folder inside this theme, and finally by issuing the command "sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css --style compressed". This way each time you change any of the scss files, styles.scss will be overwritten.
4. Activate the theme. WP-Admin > Appearance > Themes
5. Add some of the "Root Files" to the root directory of your website (explained below).
6. Style away.

Note: As a default I have created _vars.scss, containing variables, _helpers.scss, where you can add helpful classes, and _layout.scss, where the bulk of your code has to go.
If you like, you can create as many partials as you wish of course - many people like to divide their scss files in tiny bits, each referring to different modules. Your choice!

Root Files
----------

### 404 Page
If you use permanlinks (WP-Admin > Settings > Permalinks), then WordPress handles any 404s with the 404.php included in the theme. If you don't use permalinks, then add the 404.html file you find in the html5-boilerplate folder to the root of your site.

### crossdomain.xml
If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it.

### robots.txt
Tells all search engines that they can read and index all pages. This is handled by WordPress so you shouldn't need to move this to the root.

Root Images
-----------
Included are default HTML5 boilerplate icons, change them with your own.
